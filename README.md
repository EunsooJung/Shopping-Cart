- Source Code Check point

1. folder "models": It provides sequelize Schema model

```javascript
'use strict';
module.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) => {
  const Customer = sequelize.define(
    'Customer',
    {
      personId: DataTypes.INTEGER,
      isDeleted: DataTypes.BOOLEAN
    },
    {}
  );
  Customer.associate = function(models) {
    Customer.belongsTo(models.Person);
    Customer.belongsToMany(models.Address, { through: models.CustomerAddress });
  };
  return Customer;
};
```

2. folder "public": It provides images and css files

3. Controller layer: Server-Side routes

- Create all of this Shopping Cart web application's routes (maps) using a exppress router.

```javascript
/* Get all products */
var getPagedProducts = function(req, res) {
  if (req.method === 'POST') {
    cartService.addToCart(req);
    res.redirect(req.body.originalUrl);
  } else {
    fetchPaginatedProducts(req, res);
  }
};
```

4. app.js:

   - Setup Shopping Cart web applicaion's environments (npm package dependencies)
   - Import Register the Routers to access.

5. forms: It provides forms to checkout page.

6. migrations: It provides Database schema migration.

7. views: View layer to represent user interface.

8. services: It provides services to controller.

```javascript
// View Engine SetUp
nunjucks.configure(
  [
    'views',
    'views/cataloguedm',
    'views/cataloguedm/partials',
    'views/cartdm',
    'views/cartdm/partials',
    'views/checkoutdm'
  ],
  {
    autoescape: true,
    express: app
  }
);
...
// Make the cart parameters available to the templates
app.use(contextProcessor.localContext);

routerRegister(app);
```
